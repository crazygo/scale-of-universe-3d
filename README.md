# LLM Coding Benchmark: Scale of Universe 3D

This repository serves as a benchmark for evaluating the coding capabilities of different Large Language Models (LLMs) in creating complex, interactive 3D visualizations.

## Challenge Overview

The goal is to build a **Unified Universe Visualization** using React, Three.js, and Vite. The application must visualize the Earth, Solar System, and Milky Way Galaxy in a single, continuous 3D scene, allowing users to zoom seamlessly between these scales.

**Key Requirements:**
*   **Unified Model**: A single coordinate system containing Earth, Sun, and Galaxy.
*   **Accurate Dynamics**: Earth's axial tilt (23.5°), daily rotation (Time), and yearly orbit (Date).
*   **Interactive Controls**: Sliders for Time of Day and Month.
*   **Visual Consistency**: Consistent colors (Sun=Red, Galaxy Center=Purple) and markers across all scales.

Full requirements can be found in [requirements/requirements.md](./requirements/requirements.md).

## Repository Structure

*   `requirements/`: Contains the detailed project requirements and specifications.
*   `gemini-3-pro/`: Implementation generated by **Gemini 3 Pro** (Current).
*   `sonnet-4.5/`: Placeholder for implementation by **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (or future 4.5).

## Evaluation Criteria

1.  **Completeness**: Are all requirements met?
2.  **Visual Quality**: Is the visualization aesthetic and smooth?
3.  **Code Quality**: Is the code modular, readable, and well-structured?
4.  **Innovation**: Are there creative solutions to the scaling/rendering challenges?
